<!-- You can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation)    DONE 02/05/23

Within the #main-doc element, you can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of five    DONE 02/05/23

The first element within each .main-section should be a header element, which contains text that describes the topic of that section.   DONE 02/05/23    

Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java")     DONE 02/05/23 

The .main-section elements should contain at least ten p elements total (not each)      DONE 02/05/23 

The .main-section elements should contain at least five code elements total (not each)    DONE 03/05/23 <code>Haven't put this in - however; this changes the text if wrapped in this tag</code>

The .main-section elements should contain at least five li items total (not each)   DONE 03/05/23

The header element in the #navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar    DONE 03/05/23

Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world")   DONE 03/05/23

When you click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the #main-doc element (e.g. If you click on a .nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element with that id, and contains the corresponding header)   DONE 03/05/23

On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user    DONE 03/05/23
